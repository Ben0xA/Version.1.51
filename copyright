	Notes:
	===========
	This program is 100% open source and still a very BETA version. 
	I don't know of any significant bugs.... but I'm sure they may exist ;-)
	If you find one, congratulations, please forward the data back to us 
	and we'll do our best to put a fix/workaround if applicable (and time permitting...)
	Finally, feature imprevements/updates, etc, please let us know what you would
	like to see, and we'll do my best to have it incorporated into the newer 
	versions of Splinter or new projects to come.  We're here to help.
	
	Thanks again,
